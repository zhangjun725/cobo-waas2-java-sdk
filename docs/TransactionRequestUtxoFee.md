In the UTXO fee model, the transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the fee rate by the transaction size. This can be expressed as: Transaction fee = fee rate * transaction size.   You can specify the maximum fee amount to limit the transaction fee. The transaction will fail if the transaction fee exceeds the specified maximum fee amount.

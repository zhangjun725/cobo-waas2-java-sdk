# TransactionRequestEvmLegacyFee

In the legacy fee model, the transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the gas price by the gas units used by the transaction. This can be expressed as: Transaction fee =  (gas price * gas units used).   You can specify the gas limit. If the gas units used exceed the gas limit, the transaction will fail.
